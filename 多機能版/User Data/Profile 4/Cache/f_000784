Although Google is primarily known as a search engine, the company provides a diverse range of products and services. Its main source of revenue however is advertising. Google tracks users extensively both through its own products and sites, and the numerous technologies embedded into many millions of websites around the world. It uses the data gathered from most of these services to profile the interests of web users and sell advertising space to organisations based on such interest profiles as well as aligning adverts to the content on the pages where its customer's adverts appear.","DurationType":1}]},{"HostName":"pardot.com","DisplayName":"pardot.com","HostId":"rin","Description":"","PrivacyPolicy":"","Cookies":[{"thirdPartyDescription":"This is a cookie pattern that appends a unique identifier for a website visitor, used for tracking purposes.
